/**
 * The two mechanical steps either side of designing an article's cover.
 * Run both with `npm run cover`.
 *
 *   1. plate  — artwork from `articles/assets/<slug>-source.png`, fitted to
 *               1200x630 and re-grounded onto the site's page colour. This is
 *               what you place in Figma and set type against.
 *   2. card   — the Figma export at `articles/assets/<slug>-card.png`,
 *               re-grounded the same way, written to `public/articles/<slug>.png`.
 *
 * The Figma export is an *input*, never an output. Nothing here writes to a
 * file a person made, so re-running it can't destroy the design.
 *
 * Step 2 exists because Figma exports on whatever near-black the artboard was
 * given, which is a few points off `--color-page` — cool where the site is
 * warm. On its own that is invisible; against the article page, where the card
 * is the first thing under the title, it is a seam. Setting the Figma artboard
 * to #14120b makes this step a no-op, which is the better fix if you remember.
